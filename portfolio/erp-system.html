        <h2>Challenge</h2>
        <p>Our client, a global manufacturing corporation with operations across 15 countries, was struggling with fragmented legacy systems that hindered operational efficiency and real-time decision-making. Their existing infrastructure consisted of disparate systems for inventory management, financial reporting, supply chain operations, and human resources, leading to data silos and manual reconciliation processes.</p>
        <p>The company needed a unified, scalable ERP solution that could integrate all business processes, provide real-time insights, and support their aggressive growth plans while maintaining compliance with international regulations.</p>
