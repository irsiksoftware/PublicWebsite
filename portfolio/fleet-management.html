        <h2>Challenge</h2>
        <p>A national logistics company operating a fleet of 2,500 vehicles across the country was facing significant operational inefficiencies. They had limited visibility into vehicle locations, maintenance was reactive rather than proactive, fuel costs were escalating, and driver behavior issues were impacting safety and insurance costs. Route planning was manual and often suboptimal, leading to wasted time and fuel.</p>
        <p>The company needed a comprehensive fleet management solution that would provide real-time visibility, optimize routes, enable predictive maintenance, improve driver safety, reduce operational costs, and deliver actionable insights for continuous improvement.</p>
