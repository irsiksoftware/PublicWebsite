        <h2>Challenge</h2>
        <p>A leading institutional investment firm managing over $50 billion in assets was operating with outdated analytics tools that couldn't keep pace with modern market dynamics. Their existing systems provided delayed insights, lacked comprehensive risk assessment capabilities, and required extensive manual data aggregation from multiple sources. Portfolio managers were making critical investment decisions based on data that was often hours or days old.</p>
        <p>The firm needed a cutting-edge analytics platform capable of processing vast amounts of market data in real-time, providing sophisticated risk analytics, generating actionable insights, and ensuring regulatory compliance across multiple jurisdictions.</p>
