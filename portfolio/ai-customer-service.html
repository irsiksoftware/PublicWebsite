        <h2>Challenge</h2>
        <p>A leading telecommunications provider was struggling to meet the demands of their growing customer base with traditional support channels. Their call centers were overwhelmed with over 50,000 daily inquiries, leading to long wait times, inconsistent service quality, and escalating operational costs. Customer satisfaction scores were declining, and the company was losing market share to more digitally-savvy competitors.</p>
        <p>The company needed an intelligent, scalable solution that could handle routine inquiries automatically, provide 24/7 support, maintain service quality, and seamlessly escalate complex issues to human agents when necessary.</p>
