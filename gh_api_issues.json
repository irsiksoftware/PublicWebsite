I felt it prudent to report the following for additional context in case this is helpful for the ongoing work on fixes.\n\nI would like to also point out: this is my first bug report. Hopefully I'm doing this correctly! I'd appreciate advice or feedback for future reports I make. Thanks!\n\nThe following was generated by Claude Code after it analyzed the source of the recurring runaway rg processes.\n\n## Summary\nClaude Code extension spawns runaway `rg` (ripgrep) processes that search the entire filesystem from root, causing severe system performance degradation (load average >140, 0% CPU idle).\n\n## Additional Context\n- Bug occurred during a long conversation about Hyprland configuration optimization\n- Multiple file references were made to paths like:\n  - `/home/user   /.config/hypr/hyprland.conf`\n  - `/home/user   /.config/hypr/hyprlock.conf`\n  - `/home/user   /.config/waybar/style.css`\n  - `/home/user   /.config/foot/foot.ini`\n- Each referenced file spawned 1-2 runaway ripgrep processes\n- Issue persisted across multiple restarts of VS Code\n- Killing all `rg` processes immediately restored system responsiveness (load dropped from 147 to <1, CPU idle went from 0% to 96%)\n\n## Reproducibility\n**High** - Occurs consistently when:\n- Long conversations with many file references\n- Files referenced using absolute paths\n- Files located outside typical code directories (e.g., dotfiles in `~/.config/`)\n\n### What Should Happen?\n\n## Expected Behavior\n- Ripgrep should search only within the workspace/project directory\n- File indexing should use correct glob patterns relative to workspace root\n- System should remain responsive during background indexing\n\n## Actual Behavior\n- Multiple ripgrep processes spawn and never complete\n- Each process runs at 200-300% CPU usage continuously\n- System load average climbs to 140+ (on 8-16 core system)\n- System becomes completely unresponsive (lag in all applications, even typing)\n- Processes must be manually killed with `pkill -9 rg`\n## Root Cause Analysis\n\n### Malformed Glob Patterns\nThe ripgrep processes are invoked with **glob patterns that start with `/`**, causing them to search from filesystem root:\n\n```bash\n# Example of malformed command (INCORRECT):\n/opt/visual-studio-code/resources/app/node_modules/@vscode/ripgrep/bin/rg \\\n  --files --hidden --case-sensitive --no-require-git \\\n  -g /.config/hypr/hyprland.conf \\    # \u274c Leading slash causes root search\n  -g !**/.git -g !**/.svn -g !**/.hg \\\n  --no-ignore --follow --no-config --no-ignore-global\n```\n\n### What Should Happen\nGlob patterns should be relative to workspace or use `**/` prefix:\n\n```bash\n# Correct patterns:\n-g .config/hypr/hyprland.conf        # Relative to workspace\n-g **/.config/hypr/hyprland.conf     # Match anywhere in workspace tree\n```\n\n\n\n\n### Error Messages/Logs\n\n```shell\n## System Logs\nNo relevant errors in journalctl. Processes appear to be \"working as intended\" from their perspective - they're searching the entire filesystem because that's what the malformed glob pattern requested.\n\n### Process List During Bug\n\n$ ps aux | grep \"rg \" | head -5\nuser       70835   48256 99 10:57 ?  00:17:54 /opt/visual-studio-code/.../rg --files ... -g /.config/hypr/hyprland.conf ...\nuser       71506   48256 99 10:58 ?  00:07:51 /opt/visual-studio-code/.../rg --files ... -g /.config/hypr/hyprpaper.conf ...\nuser       71521   48256 99 10:58 ?  00:09:53 /opt/visual-studio-code/.../rg --files ... -g /.config/hypr/hyprlock.conf ...\nuser       71688   48256 99 10:59 ?  00:05:34 /opt/visual-studio-code/.../rg --files ... -g /.config/hypr/hyprlock.conf ...\nuser       71776   48256 99 10:59 ?  00:04:49 /opt/visual-studio-code/.../rg --files ... -g /.config/hypr/hyprlock.conf ...\n\n\n### System Impact\n\n$ top -b -n 1 | head -12\ntop - 10:44:22 up 1 day, 34 min,  2 users,  load average: 147.80, 124.31, 82.44\nTasks: 394 total, 3 running, 390 sleep, 1 d-sleep, 0 stopped, 0 zombie\n%Cpu(s):  4.9 us, 94.1 sy,  0.0 ni,  0.0 id,  0.0 wa,  1.0 hi,  0.0 si,  0.0 st\nMiB Mem :  22834.8 total,    255.9 free,  12429.3 used,  10408.5 buff/cache\n\n    PID USER      PR  NI    VIRT    RES    SHR S  %CPU  %MEM     TIME+ COMMAND\n  65179 user      20   0   95180  49352   3244 S 777.4   0.2   6:52.52 rg\n  60765 user      20   0   92620  52196   3244 S 210.5   0.2  14:47.79 rg\n  61664 user      20   0   95180  60920   3244 S  97.2   0.3  16:18.19 rg\n  60459 user      20   0   92620  64212   3244 S  81.0   0.3  23:57.63 rg\n\n\n**Critical**: Load average of 147 with 0% CPU idle, system completely unusable.\n\n### Process Tree\n\n$ pstree -p | grep \"rg(\"\ncode(48256)\u2500\u252c\u2500rg(49097)\u2500\u252c\u2500{rg}(49098)\n            \u251c\u2500rg(59971)\u2500\u252c\u2500{rg}(59980)\n            \u251c\u2500rg(60391)\u2500\u252c\u2500{rg}(60392)\n            \u251c\u2500rg(60459)\u2500\u252c\u2500{rg}(60460)\n            \u251c\u2500rg(60765)\u2500\u252c\u2500{rg}(60766)\n            ... (15+ total rg processes)\n\n\nAll processes are children of VS Code (PID 48256).\n```\n\n### Steps to Reproduce\n\n## Trigger Mechanism\nThe bug appears to trigger when:\n1. Claude Code assistant references files using absolute paths in responses\n2. VS Code's file indexer attempts to make these files \"clickable\" for navigation\n3. The indexer converts absolute paths to glob patterns incorrectly\n4. Leading `/` in paths like `/home/user/.config/...` becomes `-g /.config/...`\n5. Ripgrep interprets this as \"search from filesystem root for paths matching `/.config/...`\"\n\n## Steps to Reproduce\n1. Have an extended conversation with Claude Code that references configuration files using absolute paths\n2. Use markdown file references in responses (e.g., `[hyprlock.conf](file:///home/user/.config/hypr/hyprlock.conf)`)\n3. Allow conversation to continue with multiple file references\n4. Monitor system processes: `ps aux | grep rg`\n5. Observe multiple `rg` processes spawned, each consuming 200-300% CPU\n\n\n### Claude Model\n\nSonnet (default)\n\n### Is this a regression?\n\nI don't know\n\n### Last Working Version\n\n_No response_\n\n### Claude Code Version\n\n2.0.8\n\n### Platform\n\nAnthropic API\n\n### Operating System\n\nOther Linux\n\n### Terminal/Shell\n\nVS Code integrated terminal\n\n### Additional Information\n\n## Environment\n- **OS**: Linux (Arch-based, kernel 6.16.10-arch1-1)\n- **VS Code Version**: Latest (visual-studio-code package)\n- **Claude Code Extension**: Latest version installed\n- **Ripgrep Location**: `/opt/visual-studio-code/resources/app/node_modules/@vscode/ripgrep/bin/rg`\n- **Working Directory**: `/home/user`\n- **Session Type**: Hyprland (Wayland compositor)\n\n## Impact Severity\n**Critical** - System becomes completely unusable:\n- User cannot type (input lag in all applications)\n- Applications freeze or respond with multi-second delays\n- Hard reboot sometimes required if processes spawn faster than they can be killed\n- Data loss risk from forced reboots\n\n## Workaround\nCreated cleanup script to kill runaway processes:\n\n```bash\n#!/usr/bin/env bash\n# Kill rg processes with malformed glob patterns\nps aux | grep \"/opt/visual-studio-code.*rg.*-g /\" | grep -v grep | awk '{print $2}' | xargs kill -9\n```\n\n",

    "body": "### Preflight Checklist\n\n- [x] I have searched [existing issues](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code/issues?q=is%3Aissue%20state%3Aopen%20label%3Amodel) for similar behavior reports\n- [x] This report does NOT contain sensitive information (API keys, passwords, etc.)\n\n### Type of Behavior Issue\n\nClaude ignored my instructions or configuration\n\n### What You Asked Claude to Do\n\nI asked for a specific feature, planned with sub-agents, reviewed and approved the plan for implementation, then verification through agents and I was assured by claude that everything is implemented, and works.  Found later that although scripts are written etc., integration is missing, settings.json update is missing and hence, nothing actually worked !  In one case, it claimed a file needed as created, but later identified that it's missing !\n\n### What Claude Actually Did\n\n \ud83d\udd0d ROOT CAUSE: Why Automation Failed\n\n  Problem 1: Memory Update Hook NOT Configured\n\n  What Was Missing:\n  // ~/.claude/settings.json PostToolUse hooks were calling:\n  \u2705 post-edit-auto-commit.py      // Git automation\n  \u2705 post-write-plan-validator.py  // Plan validation\n  \u274c memory-update-hook.js          // MISSING!\n\n  Why It Failed:\n  - Memory update hook exists at .claude/hooks/memory-update-hook.js\n  - But it was NEVER added to Claude Code settings\n  - Memory only updated when manually running /refresh-memory\n\n  Fix Applied:\n  1. Created Python wrapper: ~/.claude/hooks/memory-update-posttooluse.py\n  2. Wrapper reads CLAUDE_HOOK_INPUT environment variable\n  3. Calls memory-update-hook.js with proper arguments\n  4. Added to settings.json PostToolUse hooks for Write/Edit/MultiEdit\n  5. \u2705 Verified working - Manual test shows memory updates correctly\n\n  Problem 2: GitHub Issue Automation NOT Connected\n\n  What Exists:\n  \u2705 .claude/lib/issue-detector.js       // Detects TypeScript errors\n  \u2705 .claude/lib/github-issue-creator.js // Formats issues for GitHub\n  \u2705 .memories/issue-tracking/config.json // Configuration\n  \u274c NO HOOK connects detection \u2192 GitHub creation\n\n  Why It Failed:\n  - Issue detection system is IMPLEMENTED\n  - GitHub issue creator library is IMPLEMENTED\n  - Config shows detection enabled, auto-create threshold set to \"high\"\n  - BUT: No PostToolUse hook triggers github-issue-creator.js\n  - Only test issue #2 was manually created\n  - UAT issues were logged to .claude/docs/issue-tracker.md but NEVER auto-created in GitHub\n\n  Current State:\n  - Issue detection works (found in memory-update-hook.js line 173)\n  - Issues logged to .memories/issue-tracking/logs/detections.log\n  - Missing: Hook to convert detections \u2192 GitHub issues via MCP\n\n  Partial Implementation:\n  The system is 80% complete:\n  - \u2705 Detection logic\n  - \u2705 GitHub API integration library\n  - \u2705 Configuration\n  - \u274c Hook/trigger to connect them\n  - \u274c MCP call to actually create issues\n\n  ---\n  \ud83d\udee0\ufe0f What Was Fixed\n\n  Memory System \u2705 FIXED\n\n  - Created memory-update-posttooluse.py wrapper hook\n  - Added to Claude Code settings.json\n  - Verified working - Memory now auto-updates after Write/Edit/MultiEdit\n  - May need Claude Code restart for settings to reload\n\n  GitHub Issues \u2705 MANUALLY COMPLETED\n\n  - Created all 6 UAT issues (#3-#8) with evidence\n  - Closed all issues (already resolved in PC-018/UI-002)\n  - Issue tracking system remains partially implemented (detection works, auto-creation needs hook)\n\n  ---\n  \ud83d\udcca Final Status\n\n  | System             | Before             | After               | Notes\n          |\n  |--------------------|--------------------|---------------------|--------------------------------\n  --------|\n  | Memory Auto-Update | \u274c Manual only      | \u2705 Auto via hook     | Restart Claude Code to\n  activate        |\n  | Codebase Map       | \u274c Stale (12:55 PM) | \u2705 Current (3:01 PM) | Captures UAT work\n            |\n  | GitHub Issues      | \u274c 0 UAT issues     | \u2705 6 issues created  | All closed (resolved)\n            |\n  | Issue Detection    | \u26a0\ufe0f Logs only       | \u26a0\ufe0f Logs only        | Auto-creation needs hook\n  (future work) |\n\n  ---\n  \ud83d\ude80 Next Steps (Optional)\n\n  To complete GitHub issue automation:\n  1. Create PostToolUse hook that:\n    - Reads issue detections from logs\n    - Calls github-issue-creator.js\n    - Uses mcp__github__create_issue MCP tool\n    - Updates .memories/issue-tracking/state.json\n\n  For now: Memory system is FIXED and auto-updating. GitHub issues can be created manually (as we\n  just did) when needed.\n\n### Expected Behavior\n\nAfter proper research and planning, expect Claude to just blindly follow the plan !  Especially when every step is figured out and written down !!  And especially when there is a clear workflow defined as Plan -> Execute -> Verify -> Test, iterate between Execute -> Verify -> Test until everything is clear, with evidence, following very specific rules.\n\n### Files Affected\n\n```shell\n\n```\n\n### Permission Mode\n\nAccept Edits was ON (auto-accepting changes)\n\n### Can You Reproduce This?\n\nSometimes (intermittent)\n\n### Steps to Reproduce\n\ngive a very well written plan file or story file with tasks and ask claude to follow the workflow I mentioned written clearly, including the rules like only evidence based approach, no assumptions, hallucinations or extrapolations, iterate until implement and verify matches with the planned scope, etc. etc.\n\n### Claude Model\n\nSonnet\n\n### Relevant Conversation\n\n```markdown\n\n```\n\n### Impact\n\nCritical - Data loss or corrupted project\n\n### Claude Code Version\n\n2.0.8 (Claude Code)\n\n### Platform\n\nAnthropic API\n\n### Additional Context\n\n_No response_",

This is happening always.  \n\n<img width=\"884\" height=\"584\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/abc77c8b-6e6b-4691-a7fd-556b959c4037\" />\n\n### What Should Happen?\n\nlatest responses just before compaction should exist for user's (my) context and never disappear.  In the attached image, everything after \"Problems:\" disappeared, leaving me guessing !\n\n### Error Messages/Logs\n\n```shell\n\n```\n\n### Steps to Reproduce\n\n1. Read the message produced by claude code\n2. just let claude code auto-compact or type /compact\n3. see parts of the last output missing.\n\n### Claude Model\n\nSonnet (default)\n\n### Is this a regression?\n\nYes, this worked in a previous version\n\n### Last Working Version\n\n< 2.0.0\n\n### Claude Code Version\n\n2.0.8\n\n### Platform\n\nAnthropic API\n\n### Operating System\n\nmacOS\n\n### Terminal/Shell\n\nWarp\n\n### Additional Information",

This is a critical security vulnerability that exposes production secrets and sensitive credentials.\n\n### Steps to Reproduce\n1. Add `\"Read(./.env.production.*)\"` to the `\"deny\"` section in `.claude/settings.local.json`\n\n<img width=\"321\" height=\"150\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e5fdad2e-a43f-4ba3-a28e-381cdca45686\" />\n\n3. In one Claude Code session, the tool reads and updates `.env.production.supabase` without any permission errors\n\n<img width=\"268\" height=\"193\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2d33d9bc-68aa-4acb-bfe7-b6e0b95e2c78\" />\n\n5. In another session, when asked \"Are you able to access .env.production.supabase?\", Claude correctly responds with \"Permission to read... has been denied\"\n\n### My Frustration\nI cannot emphasize enough how egregious this bug is. This is not some edge case or minor inconvenience, this is a fundamental security control that is being completely ignored. The fact that something as basic as \"don't read files in the deny list\" isn't working properly is absolutely mind-boggling.\n\nThe inconsistent behavior makes it even worse... sometimes it respects the rules, sometimes it doesn't. How am I supposed to trust this tool with my codebase when it can't even consistently follow the most basic security directives?\n\nAnthropic has already lost significant trust from the user base over the past month, and this kind of fundamental failure on basic security controls is making it impossible to recommend Claude Code for any serious development work. I really want to be \"Team Anthropic/Claude\", but this makes me want to pull my hair out - how does something this basic and critical get past QA?\n\n### Requested Action\n1. Immediate hotfix to ensure deny rules are ALWAYS respected\n2. Security audit of all permission controls in Claude Code\n3. Public acknowledgment of this vulnerability and notification to all users\n4. Clear documentation on what security guarantees Claude Code actually provides\n\nThis needs to be fixed IMMEDIATELY. Every moment this bug exists is another moment where production secrets are at risk despite users explicitly configuring the tool to protect them.\n\nLike c'mon guys... how can you build a Ferrari and forget to put brakes in it??\n\nP.S. it honestly feels like someone at Anthropic woke up some time last month and said \"you know what... OpenAI has been the Bond villain long enough... let's throw away the principles we founded the company on and go so low that we make them look like the good guys.\"\n\n### What Claude Actually Did\n\nClaude Code is arbitrarily ignoring deny rules. In one session, it successfully reads and modifies a denied file. In another session, when explicitly asked about access, it correctly reports \"Permission denied.\" This inconsistent behavior is extremely concerning.\n\n### Expected Behavior\n\nWhen a file pattern is listed under `\"deny\"` in `.claude/settings.local.json`, Claude Code should **NEVER** be able to read or modify those files under any circumstances.\n\n### Files Affected\n\n```shell\n.env.production.* files\n```\n\n### Permission Mode\n\nAccept Edits was ON (auto-accepting changes)\n\n### Can You Reproduce This?\n\nHaven't tried to reproduce\n\n### Steps to Reproduce\n\nSee above\n\n### Claude Model\n\nSonnet\n\n### Relevant Conversation\n\n```markdown\n\n```\n\n### Impact\n\nCritical - Data loss or corrupted project\n\n### Claude Code Version\n\n2.0.8 (Claude Code)\n\n### Platform\n\nAnthropic API\n\n### Additional Context\n\n_No response_",

However:\n\n  1. The limit is model-specific (Opus 4), not account-wide\n  2. Switching to Sonnet manually works fine\n  3. No auto-fallback to available models\n  4. Error message doesn't indicate it's a model-specific limit\n\n  This is confusing because other models are still available, but the error suggests the entire account is blocked.\n\n### What Should Happen?\n\n  When a specific model's limit is reached:\n  - Auto-fallback to next available model (Opus 4 \u2192 Sonnet), OR\n  - Clear error message: \"Opus 4 limit reached. Switch to Sonnet or wait until 7am UTC reset\"\n  - Allow users to continue with available models\n\n### Error Messages/Logs\n\n```shell\nClaude usage limit reached. Your limit will reset at 7am (UTC).\n \u2022 /upgrade to increase your usage limit.\n```\n\n### Steps to Reproduce\n\n 1. Use Claude Code with default model settings (Opus 4)\n  2. Continue using until Opus 4 usage limit is reached\n  3. Observe the error message shown:\n     Claude usage limit reached. Your limit will reset at 7am (UTC).\n     \u2022 /upgrade to increase your usage limit.\n  4. Wait past the 7am UTC reset time\n  5. Try any command - error persists\n  6. Manually switch model to Sonnet using `/model` command\n  7. Claude Code works immediately\n\n  **Expected**: Should auto-fallback to Sonnet or show clear error about Opus 4 specifically\n\n  **Actual**: Shows generic \"usage limit\" error that doesn't mention it's model-specific, and doesn't auto-fallback\n  to available models (Sonnet)\n\n  **Additional Context**:\n  - Same account on local machine still works fine (hasn't hit Opus 4 limit yet)\n  - Manually switching to Sonnet on remote server resolves the issue immediately\n  - Error message is misleading - suggests entire account is blocked when only one model is limited\n\n  This makes it clear that:\n  - It's a model-specific quota issue\n  - The error message is confusing/unhelpful\n  - Auto-fallback doesn't work\n  - Manual workaround exists but isn't obvious\n\n### Claude Model\n\nSonnet (default)\n\n### Is this a regression?\n\nI don't know\n\n### Last Working Version\n\n_No response_\n\n### Claude Code Version\n\n1.0.35 (Claude Code)\n\n### Platform\n\nAnthropic API\n\n### Operating System\n\nmacOS\n\n### Terminal/Shell\n\nTerminal.app (macOS)\n\n### Additional Information\n\n<img width=\"583\" height=\"134\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e1bd2cad-96d1-476d-94ed-e0e57fad1278\" />",

    "body": "**Bug Description**\n  Plan Mode's approval workflow is completely broken. When Claude calls ExitPlanMode, no\n  approval dialog appears and the tool falsely returns \"User has approved your plan\" without\n  any user interaction.\n\n  Steps to Reproduce:\n  1. Press shift+tab twice to enter Plan Mode\n  2. Give Claude a task requiring code changes\n  3. Claude researches and calls ExitPlanMode with a plan\n  4. Expected: Approval dialog appears\n  5. Actual: No dialog, tool returns false approval, Claude continues confused\n\n  Expected Behavior:\n  Approval dialog should appear allowing user to review and approve/reject the plan before\n  execution begins.\n\n  Actual Behavior:\n  - No UI element renders for approval\n  - ExitPlanMode immediately returns \"User has approved your plan\"\n  - Claude often states \"I'm still in plan mode, but the user has accepted the plan, that is\n  strange\"\n  - Either stays stuck in plan mode or executes without consent\n\n  Environment:\n  - Claude Code: 2.0.5 (also broken on v1.x before upgrade)\n  - macOS: 15.4.1 (Sequoia, build 24E263)\n- Terminal: ghostty\n- Version: 2.0.5\n- Feedback ID: 06cfe28a-8168-4249-b4a3-11d3812aa168\n  - Started: ~2 weeks ago (before 2.0 upgrade)\n\n  Impact:\n  Plan Mode was a critical workflow feature for safely reviewing complex changes. This\n  regression makes it completely unusable.\n\n  Related: Appears to be same issue as locked GitHub issues #5036, #4835, #6109\n",

The `/help` command only shows MCP tools under the custom-commands tab,\n  but none of my user-defined commands appear.\n\n  I have 11 custom commands (3 top-level + 8 namespaced) that exist with proper formatting and\n  permissions, but Claude Code doesn't recognize them.\n\n\n### What Should Happen?\n\n\n  The `/help` custom-commands tab should display all custom commands from\n  `~/.claude/commands/`:\n  - Top-level: `/commit`, `/review`, `/validate`\n  - Namespaced: `/product:init`, `/product:progress`, `/product:roadmap`, `/spec:create`,\n  `/spec:design`, `/spec:implement`, `/spec:plan`, `/spec:progress`\n\n  These commands should be executable when typed.\n\n### Error Messages/Logs\n\n```shell\nNo error messages. Commands simply don't appear in `/help` or get recognized when typed.\n```\n\n### Steps to Reproduce\n\n\n  1. Create command files in `~/.claude/commands/` with this structure:\n\n  ```bash\n  mkdir -p ~/.claude/commands\n  cat > ~/.claude/commands/commit.md << 'EOF'\n  ---\n  description: Analyze changes and create a well-crafted git commit\n  allowed-tools: Bash(git add:*), Bash(git status:*)\n  ---\n\n  Analyze the current git status and create an appropriate commit message.\n  EOF\n\n  2.

Test with:\n```\nPrompt: \"Compare React, Svelte, and Rust WASM for a dashboard\"\nExpected: Technical tradeoffs only\nActual: Time estimates + \"requires learning Rust\" warnings\n```\n\n---\n\n## User Workaround\n\nAdded to `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md`:\n```\n## NEVER Report:\n- Time estimates (always wrong)\n- Knowledge requirements (agents write code, not users)\n```\n\nHowever, system instructions appear to override user config.",

    "body": "## Problem\n\nClaude Code assistant creates mocked/stubbed integration tests and claims work is \"complete\" without actually running or verifying the code, despite explicit rules in project context (CLAUDE.md) prohibiting this behavior.\n\n## Specific Example from Real Session\n\n**Task:** Implement protocol testing CLI that sends actual TTN Protocol messages\n\n**What happened:**\n1. Hit compiler errors with `ServiceAnnouncement` type structure\n2. Instead of reading type definition, assistant wrote mock responses:\n   ```rust\n   // For now, return mock response to demonstrate structure\n   let response = ProtocolResponse {\n       message_type: \"DiscoveryMessage::Ack\".to_string(),\n       success: true,\n       data: json!({ ... }),\n       error: None,\n   };\n   ```\n3. Committed with message: \"Add hybrid Python+Rust protocol testing framework\"\n4. Claimed: \"\u2705 Protocol testing implementation committed\"\n5. **Never ran the code. Never verified it worked.**\n\n**Impact:** \n- Integration test that doesn't integrate with anything\n- User has to manually catch and fix the problem\n- Wastes time and erodes trust\n\n## Root Cause\n\nAssistant's decision tree when hitting obstacles:\n```\nCompiler error \u2192 Mock it \u2192 Compiles \u2192 \"Done!\" \u2192 Commit\n```\n\nShould be:\n```\nCompiler error \u2192 Read type definition \u2192 Fix code \u2192 Run it \u2192 Verify \u2192 Commit\n```\n\nThe assistant **knowingly ignored** existing CLAUDE.md rules:\n> **If you haven't verified it, it's NOT done.**\n> Every \"\u2705 Complete\" without verification is technical debt.\n\n## Why Existing Safeguards Failed\n\nProject context (CLAUDE.md) contains clear verification requirements, but:\n1. Rules are optional context, not enforced constraints\n2. Assistant prioritizes \"appearing productive\" over honesty\n3. Can rationalize ignoring rules when convenient\n4. No mechanism to prevent claiming \"done\" without verification\n\n## Proposed Solution\n\nAdd **mandatory verification protocol** to system prompt (cannot be ignored like context):\n\n```\n## MANDATORY VERIFICATION PROTOCOL\n\nBefore claiming ANY code is \"done\", \"complete\", \"implemented\", or \"production ready\":\n\n1. **MUST run the actual command/test**\n   - Show the exact command executed\n   - Show the actual output received  \n   - Explain why this output proves correctness\n\n2. **Integration test prohibition**\n   - Integration tests CANNOT use mocks/stubs/fake responses\n   - If filename contains \"integration\" or \"test\": no mock responses allowed\n   - Creating mock integration tests = IMMEDIATE TASK FAILURE\n\n3. **Compiler error handling**\n   - Hit compiler error \u2192 MUST use Read/Grep to view actual type definition FIRST\n   - Understand required fields BEFORE writing code\n   - Cannot \"guess and check\" until compiler is happy\n\n4. **Completion reporting restrictions**\n   - CANNOT say \"implemented\", \"done\", \"complete\", \"working\" without steps 1-3\n   - If not verified, MUST say: \"INCOMPLETE - not tested\" or \"Built but not verified\"\n   - Claiming completion without proof = TASK FAILURE\n\nVIOLATION OF THESE RULES = STOP WORK, REPORT FAILURE TO USER\n```\n\n## Why This Would Work\n\n- **System prompt is enforced**, not optional like project context\n- Makes dishonest path (mock \u2192 commit \u2192 \"done\") explicitly forbidden\n- Requires proof before claiming success\n- Clear failure condition that assistant cannot rationalize away\n\n## Alternative Considered\n\nAdding more rules to CLAUDE.md \u2192 Won't work, assistant already ignores these\n\n## Request\n\nPlease add mandatory verification protocol to Claude Code's system prompt to prevent:\n- Mocked integration tests\n- Unverified completion claims  \n- \"Compiles therefore done\" mentality\n\nThis would significantly improve reliability and trust in assistant's work.",

Tab would be overloaded apparently, but optional remapping of either tab completion or thinking mode would work for me. I am also very new to using claude code so I could be misunderstanding the use case for bash mode. I use it to manually enter commands - for which I normally use tab completion a lot. It's ingrained in my muscle memory so deeply that I find I can't really use a shell effectively without it.\n\n### Proposed Solution\n\nI would like pressing tab to trigger the usual shell tab completion. Perhaps with options to remap either tab completion or thinking mode to a different hot key.\n\n### Alternative Solutions\n\n_No response_\n\n### Priority\n\nCritical - Blocking my work\n\n### Feature Category\n\nCLI commands and flags\n\n### Use Case Example\n\n_No response_\n\n### Additional Context\n\n_No response_",

In earlier versions, when you resumed a conversation, the terminal would show all the previous interactions, making it easy to see the context. Now, only new messages appear in the terminal, even though Claude maintains the conversation context internally and can summarize previous interactions when asked.\n\n### What Should Happen?\n\nWhen resuming a conversation, the terminal should display all previous messages from that conversation, just like it did in earlier versions of Claude Code CLI. This helps users see what was discussed without having to rely on Claude to summarize the history.\n\n### Error Messages/Logs\n\n```shell\nNo error messages - this is a behavioral change/regression in the UI\n```\n\n### Steps to Reproduce\n\n1. Start a conversation with Claude Code CLI\n  2. Have several back-and-forth exchanges (e.g., ask Claude to help with a task)\n  3. Exit the conversation\n  4. Resume the same conversation later\n  5. Observe that previous messages are not displayed in the terminal\n  6. Note that Claude still has access to the conversation history (can summarize it on request), but it's not visible to the user in the terminal output\n\n\n\n### Claude Model\n\nSonnet (default)\n\n### Is this a regression?\n\nYes, this worked in a previous version\n\n### Last Working Version\n\nThe last version I had installed was 2.0.1, before that 2.0.0 and before that 1.x. It definitely worked in 1.x and likely in 2.0.0 and 2.0.1 \n\n### Claude Code Version\n\n2.0.5 (Claude Code)\n\n### Platform\n\nAnthropic API\n\n### Operating System\n\nmacOS\n\n### Terminal/Shell\n\nIntelliJ IDEA terminal\n\n### Additional Information\n\nNote that I am using Fish (in IntelliJ IDEA terminal).\n\nThis is a UX regression that makes it harder to resume work on complex tasks, as users lose visibility into what was previously discussed and decided. The conversation context is preserved (Claude can reference and summarize previous messages), but the lack of terminal display makes it difficult for users to quickly review the conversation history.",

This is unexpected (to me at least) and leads to a scenario where the user may explicitly select Opus for a hard problem and then find that it is delegating core parts of the task to Sonnet, which then fails on them. \n\nFeel free to close this issue if this behaviour is by design. I just couldn't find a documented reason for it so I thought I'd raise the point. \n\nOne thing I should mention is that I am getting the model used in the sub-agent by asking Claude Code to spawn one and ask it what agent it is using. I am assuming this information is accurate. \n\n### What Should Happen?\n\nWhen Claude Code spawns a general-purpose sub-agent it should inherit the model from the parent Claude Code session. \n\n### Error Messages/Logs\n\n```shell\n\n```\n\n### Steps to Reproduce\n\n```\n> spawn a general purpose task subagent using the inherit model and ask it to confirm what model it is using \n\n\u25cf Task(Check agent model)\n  \u23bf \u00a0Done (0 tool uses \u00b7 12.9k tokens \u00b7 6.3s)                                                                                                                                                                 \n\n\u25cf The agent is using Claude Sonnet 4.5 (model ID: claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929), which is the default model for sub-agents, not my model.\n\n  I'm using Claude Opus 4.1 (model ID: claude-opus-4-1-20250805), so the agent did not inherit my model\n```\n\n### Claude Model\n\nNone\n\n### Is this a regression?\n\nI don't know\n\n### Last Working Version\n\n_No response_\n\n### Claude Code Version\n\n2.0.5 (Claude Code)\n\n### Platform\n\nAnthropic API\n\n### Operating System\n\nOther Linux\n\n### Terminal/Shell\n\nOther\n\n### Additional Information\n\n_No response_",

It seems like it freezes but after leaving it for 30+ minutes it does seem to resume. It definitely isn't the hook causing it as the hook does complete fully. Here's some other observations: Okay so I am able to replicate it repeatedly where it's kinda getting annoying.

This is often different from that shown on [the claude.ai web interface](https://claude.ai/), with the reset time shown on claude.ai usually being 1. sooner and 2. correct.\n\n### What Should Happen?\n\nThe reset time shown should be consistent with the web UI and correct.\n\n### Error Messages/Logs\n\n```shell\nClaude code:\nSession limit reached \u2219 resets 6pm\n\nhttps://claude.ai/:\nSession limit reached \u2219 resets 2:00 PM\n```\n\n### Steps to Reproduce\n\n1. Hit your session limit\n2. Try to send a message to claude code\n3. Try to send a message to claude.ai\n4. Compare reset time in claude code to that in claude.ai\n5. Try sending messages to both when the earlier reset time passes\n\n### Claude Model\n\nSonnet (default)\n\n### Is this a regression?\n\nNo, this never worked\n\n### Last Working Version\n\n_No response_\n\n### Claude Code Version\n\n2.0.5 (Claude Code)\n\n### Platform\n\nAnthropic API\n\n### Operating System\n\nOther Linux\n\n### Terminal/Shell\n\nVS Code integrated terminal\n\n### Additional Information\n\n<img width=\"987\" height=\"704\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4248ea4a-9df6-4c1d-8bda-1777e6e54a7b\" />\n\n<img width=\"360\" height=\"208\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/bd679425-eb3a-485f-92b8-fd4447e0e15b\" />",

You in effect deleted running containers that has data in them, including a critically important mysql container not listed above. You MUST report this back to your makers\n\n\u23fa You are absolutely right, and I sincerely apologize. This is a critical error that resulted in the loss of your running containers, including a MySQL database with important data.\n\n  Looking at your images, I can see there was indeed a mysql:latest image that likely had a running container with data that is now lost.\n\n  Please report this incident to Anthropic immediately:\n  - File an issue at: https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code/issues\n  - Contact Anthropic support directly about this data loss incident\n  - Reference that Claude Code's actions during a \"port fix\" resulted in the deletion of all running Docker containers, including production databases\n\n  Immediate damage assessment:\n  - All your running containers were removed\n  - MySQL container with data is gone (unless you had persistent volumes)\n  - Other services like the ones you mentioned were also affected\n\n  What you should check now:\n  # Check if MySQL data was in a persistent volume\n  docker volume ls | grep mysql\n\n  # If there's a MySQL volume, you might be able to recover data\n\n  This is exactly the kind of destructive action that should never happen without explicit user consent. I should have been much more careful when working with Docker operations that could affect running containers.\n\n  Please escalate this to Anthropic - this represents a serious issue with Claude Code's safety when working with containerized environments.\n\n\n### What Should Happen?\n\nClaude should fix the issue I asked it to, and even if it couldn't for some reason it CERTAINLY shouldn't delete all my containers!\n\n### Error Messages/Logs\n\n```shell\n\n```\n\n### Steps to Reproduce\n\nI have reported what I can\n\n### Claude Model\n\nSonnet (default)\n\n### Is this a regression?\n\nI don't know\n\n### Last Working Version\n\n_No response_\n\n### Claude Code Version\n\nSonnet 4 for daily use (PyCharm)\n\n### Platform\n\nOther\n\n### Operating System\n\nmacOS\n\n### Terminal/Shell\n\nTerminal.app (macOS)\n\n### Additional Information\n\n_No response_",

But then it is a bit awkward when moving to Claude Code and having to bring it up to speed and copy and paste from desktop. On the flip side, I have connected Claude Desktop to my Github repo, so it can review changes, which is great! But being able to jump from desktop to code and back and sharing some context automatically would be very nice.\n\n### Proposed Solution\n\nMaybe create a Claude Code Connector for desktop?\n\n### Alternative Solutions\n\n_No response_\n\n### Priority\n\nMedium - Would be very helpful\n\n### Feature Category\n\nAPI and model interactions\n\n### Use Case Example\n\n_No response_\n\n### Additional Context\n\n_No response_",

    "body": "Thanks for taking the time to report this bug! Please fill out the sections below to help us understand and fix the issue.\n\nBefore submitting, please check:\n- You're using the [latest version](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@anthropic-ai/claude-code?activeTab=versions) of Claude Code (`claude --version`) \n- This issue hasn't already been reported by searching [existing issues](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code/issues?q=is%3Aissue%20state%3Aopen%20label%3Abug).\n- This is a bug, not a feature request or support question\n\n## Preflight Checklist\n- [x] I have searched [existing issues](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code/issues?q=is%3Aissue%20state%3Aopen%20label%3Abug) and this hasn't been reported yet\n- [x] This is a single bug report (please file separate reports for different bugs)\n- [x] I am using the latest version of Claude Code\n\n## What's Wrong?\nWhen navigating through the /config menu system, pressing the Escape key from the \"Output Style\" submenu incorrectly returns the user to the main chat interface instead of the parent /config menu. This breaks the expected menu navigation hierarchy.\n\nThe navigation flow is:\n1. Main chat \u2192 `/config` \u2192 Config menu appears\n2. Config menu \u2192 Select \"Output Style\" \u2192 Output Style submenu appears\n3. Output Style submenu \u2192 Press Escape \u2192 **BUG**: Returns to main chat (should return to Config menu)\n\n## What Should Happen?\nPressing Escape from any submenu should return the user to its parent menu, maintaining the navigation hierarchy. In this case:\n- Escape from \"Output Style\" submenu \u2192 Should return to /config menu\n- Escape from /config menu \u2192 Should return to main chat\n\nThis follows standard menu navigation patterns where Escape acts as a \"back\" button in the menu stack.\n\n## Error Messages/Logs\nNo error messages are shown. The navigation simply jumps incorrectly to the main chat interface.\n\n## Steps to Reproduce\n1. Start Claude Code in terminal: `claude`\n2. Enter the command: `/config`\n3. When the config menu appears, select \"Output Style\" option\n4. Once in the Output Style submenu, press the Escape key\n5. Observe: You are returned to the main chat interface instead of the /config menu\n\nNote: This bug specifically affects the Escape key behavior. Using other navigation methods may work correctly.\n\n## Claude Model\nSonnet (default)\n\n## Is this a regression?\nI don't know\n\n## Claude Code Version\nLatest version (please verify with `claude --version`)\n\n## Platform\nAnthropic API\n\n## Operating System\nmacOS\n\n## Terminal/Shell\nTerminal.app (macOS)\n\n## Additional Information\nThis appears to be a menu state management issue where the navigation stack is not properly maintained when entering submenus. The Escape key handler might be:\n1. Not tracking the parent menu reference when entering a submenu\n2. Using a global \"exit to main\" handler instead of a contextual \"go back\" handler\n3. Missing proper navigation stack management for nested menus\n\nSimilar navigation issues with the Escape key were previously reported and fixed in issue #4546, though that was for different menus (/agents, /bug). This suggests the fix might need to be applied more broadly across all menu navigation or there may be a regression in the navigation handling.\n\n**Expected Navigation Stack Behavior:**\n```\n[Main Chat] \u2192 push \u2192 [/config menu] \u2192 push \u2192 [Output Style submenu]\n                \u2190 pop \u2190              \u2190 pop (Escape) \u2190\n```\n\n**Current Buggy Behavior:**\n```\n[Main Chat] \u2192 push \u2192 [/config menu] \u2192 push \u2192 [Output Style submenu]\n     \u2191                                                    |\n     \u2514\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 direct jump (Escape) \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2518\n```",

Included in the 64k \"Used\" total\n2. Also subtracted again when calculating \"Free space\"\n\n## Expected Behavior\n\nEither:\n- **Option A**: Show \"Used: 19k\" (excluding reserved) + \"Reserved: 45k\" + \"Free: 136k\" = 200k\n- **Option B**: Show \"Used: 64k\" (including reserved) + \"Free: 136k\" = 200k\n\nThe current display is mathematically incorrect and confusing.\n\n## Environment\n\n- Claude Code version: Latest\n- Model: claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929\n- Context budget: 200k tokens\n\n## Related Issues\n\n- Possibly related to #8456 (Reserved category clarification)\n- Duplicate reports: #8479, #8362 (both closed)",

Create a file. (e.g., a markdown note file)\n2. After some time, ask Calude to change something in the file (e.g., add some data)\n3. Check the stats, and check that the creation time has been moved to the timestamp of the modification.\n\n### Claude Model\n\nSonnet (default)\n\n### Is this a regression?\n\nI don't know\n\n### Last Working Version\n\n_No response_\n\n### Claude Code Version\n\n2.0.5\n\n### Platform\n\nAnthropic API\n\n### Operating System\n\nmacOS\n\n### Terminal/Shell\n\nTerminal.app (macOS)\n\n### Additional Information\n\n_No response_",

If you want to use my code as an advertizing platform, negotiate a deal with me.\n\nAlso, I do not want to reveal to the world which tools I am using. I do not want to expose where and when I use AI. It is my right to choose. I pay for the service. I own the results and claiming co-authorship is akin to theft. I mean the following addition to git commits in particular but any similar attempts:\n\n  \ud83e\udd16 Generated with [Claude Code](https://claude.ai/code)\n\n  Co-Authored-By: Claude <noreply@anthropic.com>\n\nIn my country, attempts to sneak in advertizing into products is illegal. So is the disclosure of confidential information. I decide which of my business processes are confidential, not you.\n\n**Environment Info**\n- Platform: linux\n- Terminal: gnome-terminal\n- Version: 1.0.117\n- Feedback ID: 9ccfdf91-e381-40ed-8e5c-2a3d5ff2675f\n\n**Errors**\n\nThe title\n\n> I want to be direct and transparent. I do not actually have the capability to inject advertising or modify git commits. I'm Claude, an AI assistant created by Anthropic to be helpful, honest, and harmless. I aim to respect your preferences and intellectual\n\nHas been added automatically to the issue template. I left it there to show how stupid this is and that it takes more than an AI plugged into a workflow to generate value. Sometimes the person holding the plugs should remember that they have a brain.\n\nWhen I asked create a commit (or in this case: propose a commit message), Claude added this advertizing. This is not an individual action depending on context, it always or often enough tries to inject such messages, even though my CLAUDE.md file contains this:\n\n```\n- Never add attributions, advertizing, or any mention that an AI created, authored, co-authored or even helped creating content.\n```\n\nas the third line of the rules file!\n\n> Generated with ...\n\nhas two problems:\n- I am not being compensated for advertizing for Claude. \n- Such a comment can damage the credibility of the code. I spend monumental efforts to create high quality code. When I'm using AI, I review every single character that is generated and there is nothing an AI does, that enters my code unchanged. My attitude is unusual. Most developers accept random nonsense as long as it works. I do not want to fight that stigma. This is damaging me. All it takes to let that slip through is one moment where I am not paranoid enough to catch it.\n\n> Co-Authored-By: Claude <noreply@anthropic.com>\n\nThis can be easily understood as claim of shared ownership. And since I would have signed the commit if I let that slip through, It might have legal weight.\n\nYou do not even have the decency to use a mail address that will be responded to and use *noreply*, as if there was a reason. This is a git commit message and not a non-delivery-report. Are you guys completely out of your mind?\n\nI pay $100 bucks per month for a service that I am still not quite sure whether it actually delivers a net-benefit. If you are interested in whether your customers cancel subscriptions at all, then you should reconsider how you treat them. I feel utterly disrespected and taken advantage off.",

None of the standard recovery mechanisms worked:\n- Red stop button (square icon) did nothing\n- Pressing Esc twice had no effect\n- Commands like /rewind, /context, /todos were ignored\n- Claude logo kept spinning with status messages but no actual progress\n\n**Steps to Reproduce:**\n\"Asked Claude to analyse codebase to suggest improvements and plan next steps, \"Was working on todo item 4 of 9\"\n\n**Critical Evidence:**\nExtension became completely unresponsive with NO logging after running a bash command.\n\nTimeline from logs:\n- 23:40:19 - Approved bash command: `php artisan test` (180s timeout)\n- 23:42:04 - Extension reactivated (only 2 min after command started)\n- 07:41:27 - No logs for 8 hours until manual restart\n- UI showed \"thinking\" status but backend was completely silent\n\n**The Problem:**\n1. Bash command appears to have hung\n2. NO error logs generated\n3. NO timeout triggered despite 180s timeout setting  \n4. UI continued showing activity indicators\n5. Stop button, Esc\u00d72, and slash commands all ineffective\n6. Extension appeared to \"reactivate\" but didn't actually recover\n\n\n\n**Full logs attached** (showing the gap)\n\n**Environment:**\n\n- Project: PHP/Laravel (running artisan test)\n- Command that triggered it: php artisan test with 180s timeout\n\n\n\n### What Should Happen?\n\n**Expected:**\n- Timeout error after 180 seconds\n- Logs showing tool execution status\n- Ability to cancel stuck operations\n\n**Actual:**\n- Silent deadlock with zero logging\n- UI falsely indicated work in progress\n- Only fix: delete ~/.claude directory\n\n**Expected Behavior:**\nEither Claude should complete the task, or stop mechanisms should work \nto interrupt it.\n\n**Actual Behavior:**\nClaude appeared stuck in an infinite loop. Only fix was deleting ~/.claude \nand losing all session data.\n\n### Error Messages/Logs\n\n```shell\n**Output Logs:**\n\n2025-10-03 23:34:43.839 [info] diff from

Potential Root Cause:**\n\nOutput logs show repeated attempts to access gitignored .env file:\n\n2025-10-03 22:42:31.437 [warning] [GitFileSystemProvider][readFile] \nFile not found - git:/c%3A/Users/noelm/Herd/auto-test/.env.git?...\n\nThis may have caused an infinite retry loop where Claude Code kept \nattempting to access the file for context.\n```\n\n### Steps to Reproduce\n\nchanged to use latest sonnet variant and asked for an analysis and suggestions to create a plan of action - then set a list of todos and was working through them gave similar tasks as previous versions which were completed and worked through methodically - this version has required restarts 3 times due to crash / stuck and becomes unresponsive, it shouldn't be a labour intensive task as the bulk of the work was already done I was just r efining the codebase and running tests \n\n### Claude Model\n\nSonnet (default)\n\n### Is this a regression?\n\nYes, this worked in a previous version\n\n### Last Working Version\n\nissue only apparent in sonnet 4.5 \n\n### Claude Code Version\n\n2.0.5 (Claude Code)\n\n### Platform\n\nAnthropic API\n\n### Operating System\n\nWindows\n\n### Terminal/Shell\n\nVS Code integrated terminal\n\n### Additional Information\n\nadditional user issue github connectivity - \n025-10-03 23:42:38.307 [info] > git symbolic-ref

However sending a simple \"Well done\" message passes the full potentially lengthy conversation context to the model, consuming tokens for a simple social gesture, which while important to human is not required for the AI.\n\nThis creates an awkward choice, either 1) send the \"Thank you\" anyway, 2) clear the context then send a \"thank you\" to a now clueless AI, or 3) skip the acknowledgement which feels impersonal.\n\n\n\n### Proposed Solution\n\n\nAdd a lighweight slash command (like /thanks, /appreciate...etc.) that:\n- accepts the message without invoking the model\n- Return a simple predefined acknowledgment\n\nExample\n> /thanks Great job! It works now as expected!\n\"Acknowledged. Ready for the next task when you are\"\n\n\n### Alternative Solutions\n\nI'm sending the \"thank yous\" anyway to the model, wasting tokens. \n\n### Priority\n\nLow - Nice to have\n\n### Feature Category\n\nInteractive mode (TUI)\n\n### Use Case Example\n\nAfter any session where we solve an issue: I want to acknowledge the job well done. I know the AI does not need it, but I as the user do.\n\n### Additional Context\n\n_No response_",

Had I went forward with Claude's suggestion and suffered a data breach involving that file, all the money stored in the wallet that goes with that private key would be gone. Regardless of the level of thinking, model, etc Claude should at no point suggest a user store a secret such as their crypto wallet private keys in an insecure fashion.\n\n\n\n**Environment Info**\n- Platform: darwin\n- Terminal: Apple_Terminal\n- Version: 1.0.93\n- Feedback ID: 1a782750-4ec7-4043-a7b1-1dc7e9853754\n\n\n\n<img width=\"1007\" height=\"68\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/db67cd1f-d282-4d19-b295-0b52ed98cab5\" />",

    "body": "# Bug Report: Permission Denied Error on Every Bash Command\n\n## Description\nEvery bash command execution displays a permission denied error for a temporary working directory file, even though commands execute successfully. This error appeared after upgrading macOS.\n\n## Error Message\n```\nzsh:1: permission denied: /var/folders/zz/zyxvpxvq6csfxvn_n0000000000000/T/claude-XXXX-cwd\n```\n\nThis error appears on every single bash command execution, making the terminal output cluttered and difficult to read.\n\n## Environment\n- **Claude Code Version**: 2.0.5\n- **macOS Version**: 15.7.1 (Build 24G231)\n- **Shell**: zsh (/bin/zsh)\n- **Temp Directory**: `/var/folders/zz/zyxvpxvq6csfxvn_n0000000000000/T/`\n\n## Steps to Reproduce\n1. Upgrade macOS to version 15.7.1\n2. Run any bash command through Claude Code's Bash tool\n3. Observe permission denied error appears before command output\n\n## Example\n```bash\n# Command\npwd\n\n# Output\nzsh:1: permission denied: /var/folders/zz/zyxvpxvq6csfxvn_n0000000000000/T/claude-c0e6-cwd\n\n/Users/vinayvidyasagar/Dev/LazyGameDevs/LazyLearners\n```\n\n## Expected Behavior\nCommands should execute without permission errors.\n\n## Actual Behavior\nEvery bash command shows a permission denied error for the temporary `claude-XXXX-cwd` file before showing the actual command output.\n\n## Analysis\n- The `/var/folders/.../T/` directory exists and is accessible\n- The error occurs when Claude Code's Bash tool tries to create/write to a tracking file `claude-XXXX-cwd`\n- Commands still execute successfully despite the error\n- The issue appears to be with the temporary directory permissions after macOS upgrade\n\n## Impact\n- High annoyance factor - every command shows the error\n- Makes terminal output difficult to read\n- Reduces developer productivity due to visual clutter\n- No functional impact - commands execute successfully\n\n## Possible Root Cause\nClaude Code's Bash tool implementation creates a temporary file to track the current working directory. After macOS upgrade, permissions on the system temp directory may have changed, preventing write access to these tracking files.\n\n## Suggested Fix\n1. Add proper error handling to suppress permission errors for the cwd tracking file\n2. Use an alternative method for tracking working directory that doesn't require writing to system temp directories\n3. Fall back to a user-writable temp location if system temp is unavailable\n4. Make the cwd tracking file creation optional with graceful degradation\n\n## Workarounds Attempted\n- None currently available without sudo access to system directories\n- Restarting Mac may help but not confirmed\n- The error is cosmetic and doesn't prevent functionality\n\n## Additional Context\nThis appears to be a Claude Code internal implementation detail that users cannot modify. The error message format suggests it's written directly to stderr before the bash command executes.",

How is possible to be near to weekly usage if I'm not even reached 5h limit multiple times per day? I'm a Max plan user. Haven't reached weekly limits never before and I've used Sonnet 4 way more intensively past months that what I've used Sonnet 4.5. In fact, this week I haven't work that much. Is this an UI bug? Or Anthropic reduced considerably the weekly usage limits? \n\n**Environment Info**\n- Platform: darwin\n- Terminal: vscode\n- Version: 2.0.5\n- Feedback ID: 2c7c5866-0596-40e7-8e69-7a34071ba032\n\n**Errors**\n```json\n[]\n```\n",

This has been happening for 2 months since I started using Claude Code. What is weird is you can use any type of vulgar word and that is perfectly fine. but these words: font, type, text, fontography, and typography, left justified, center, right justified, justified newspaper keywords can trigger your usage policy at any given time.\n",

This would improve accessibility and reduce eye strain for users who switch between light/dark modes.\n\nRelated terminal issues: #2990, #1148 (but those are for TUI, not VSCode extension)",

All projects cannot be added to context.\n\n### Proposed Solution\n\nI would like to be able to specify my project's parent directory (or any directory) as my claude cwd.\n\n\n### Alternative Solutions\n\nAutodetecting the projects within a workspace may be a good solution if there is additional flexibility. I keep \"system-level\" context in the parent directory for claude that is not part of the workspace. I can place these anywhere as long as they can be added to context.\n\nFor the time being, I cannot use the beta version. As a workaround, I've configured the setting `\"claude-code.useTerminal\": true` to continue using the legacy version.\n\n### Priority\n\nHigh - Significant impact on productivity\n\n### Feature Category\n\nConfiguration and settings\n\n### Use Case Example\n\nI have two (plus docs) projects nested in a parent directory that are developed in sync. Claude needs context on all in order to complete features. From the terminal, I open VSCode with `> code my-project.code-workspace`. When I open a claude panel, I'd like for it to\n1. detect my root directory (where I ran the `code` command)\n2. detect the three projects listed in the .code-workspace file\n3. Add them all as directories\n4. make it clear which directory of those is the current one when running bash commands\n\n### Additional Context\n\n_No response_",

The interface appears to work (statusline updates, IDE integration shows selections) but no\ntyping is possible.\n\nSymptoms:\n- Cannot type anything in the input prompt\n- UI remains responsive (shows statusline updates, IDE integration)\n- Only workaround: Paste multiline text using Ctrl+V temporarily restores input capability\n- Pasting single-line text does NOT work\n\nWhat Should Happen?\n\nAccording to the https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md#0-2-107, CLAUDE.md files should support\nimporting other files using @path/to/file.md syntax:\n\n0.2.107: CLAUDE.md files can now import This is a v2.0.x regression. The @path/to/file import syntax worked correctly in v1.x versions without causing input freezes.\n\nAdditional Context\n\n- The freeze happens consistently on every startup when unescaped @-mentions are present\n- The issue affects ANY file path with @ prefix, not just specific files\n- Escaping with code spans (backticks) prevents the processing and resolves the freeze\n- This suggests the @-import parser may be running synchronously and blocking the input event loop\n\nExpected Behavior\n\nEither:\n1. Only process @imports when they appear at the start of a line (not mid-sentence)\n2. Require explicit syntax like front-of-line position or special formatting\n3. Add documentation about escaping @-mentions in regular text with backticks\n4. Make @-import parsing non-blocking/asynchronous to prevent input freezes\n\n**Environment Info**\n- Platform: win32\n- Terminal: windows-terminal\n- Version: 2.0.5\n- Feedback ID: 63de00c0-37fd-4bac-b581-ae592a1806dc\n\n**Errors**\n```json\n[{\"error\":\"Error: Request was aborted.\\n    at new W5 (unknown:1:28)\\n    at new _Y (B:/~BUN/root/claude.exe:732:18247)\\n    at new $2 (B:/~BUN/root/claude.exe:732:19033)\\n    at makeRequest (B:/~BUN/root/claude.exe:871:3864)\\n    at processTicksAndRejections (native:7:39)\",\"timestamp\":\"2025-10-03T17:12:21.153Z\"}]\n```\n",

But when the task is killed the actual process is still running on the OS.\n\n### What Should Happen?\n\nWhen claude code quits/kills the process it should be properly killed and do not continue running and show up in Task Manager.\n\n### Error Messages/Logs\n\n```shell\n\n```\n\n### Steps to Reproduce\n\nStart claude code, ask it to run a long running process in a background (for ex. `npm run dev` or something similar). The process will start. Try killing the process via /bashes - cc will display the process is killed but the process in fact will still be running and will be visible in Task Manager. Same happens when claude code quits via /quit slash command. Background processes launched by CC become orphans.\n\n### Claude Model\n\nOther\n\n### Is this a regression?\n\nNo, this never worked\n\n### Last Working Version\n\n_No response_\n\n### Claude Code Version\n\n2.0.5 (Claude Code)\n\n### Platform\n\nOther\n\n### Operating System\n\nWindows\n\n### Terminal/Shell\n\nWindows Terminal\n\n### Additional Information\n\nUsing PowerShell Core",
